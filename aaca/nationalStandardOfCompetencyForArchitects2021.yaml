## Performance Criteria describe discrete aspects of architectural practice and are organised under the Units of Competency. Each Unit has a corresponding set of criteria for each of the three competency profiles.
## The NSCA does not prioritise any unit or performance criteria. The ordering of the performance criteria does not suppose a particular mode of practice or project type, nor is there any weighting applied to individual performance criteria in the NSCA.

	name: Regulatory Requirements and Obligations
	summary: Understand, demonstrate, and comply with the regulatory requirements and obligations for architectural practice—including professional codes of conduct, continuing professional development, and professional indemnity insurance .
	onGraduation: Understand the regulatory requirements and obligations pertaining to practice as an architect, including professional codes of conduct and obligations for continuing professional development and professional indemnity insurance.
	pointOfRegistration: Demonstrate understanding of the regulatory requirements and obligations pertaining to practice as an architect, including legislation, professional codes of conduct, and obligations for continuing professional development and professional indemnity insurance.
	postRegistration: Comply with the regulatory requirements and obligations pertaining to practice as an architect, including legislation, professional codes of conduct, obligations for continuing professional development and professional indemnity insurance.
	explanatoryNotes: Architects must have a broad knowledge of the regulatory frameworks pertaining to architectural practice, practice management and registration as an architect. A sound working knowledge, including recognition of the hierarchy and interrelationships between the legislations, is required to ensure architects can identify and comply with these obligations.
	examples: >-
At graduation, this could be demonstrated through an awareness of the ethical criteria embedded in the relevant state/territory Architects Acts and professional code of conduct, the Architects Award and other legislation relevant to the business of architecture – for example, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, Sex Discrimination Act 1984, Disability Discrimination Act 1992, and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.
At registration, this would be demonstrated through identifying the legal obligations for registration as an architect, as well as describing the code of conduct requirements contained within a client/architect agreement and demonstrating an understanding of obligations of employers and employees under the Architects Award.
Post registration, this would be demonstrated by undertaking continuing professional development to maintain skills and knowledge, maintaining registration with the relevant state/territory board of architects, meeting all obligations under the Architects Award and National Employment Standards, and being covered by appropriate professional indemnity insurance.
