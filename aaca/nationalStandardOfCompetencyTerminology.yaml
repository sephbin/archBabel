# UNDERSTANDING COUNTRY
Country: >
  is broadly understood as a holistic worldview that incorporates human, non-human and all the complex systems that connect them. Country relates to First Nations Peoples’ cultural groups and the places to which they belong. It is understood in cultural, spiritual and tangible ways. An understanding of Country includes intangible ideas about place, Law, lore, language, customs, spirit, cultural practice, identity and kin. It is very important to recognise that First Nations Peoples’ ‘understanding of Country’ differs between groups, individuals and contexts.
First Nations Peoples: >
  refer to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. These terms recognise and respect the position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as those who first inhabited and cared for the continent now called Australia. Aboriginal peoples are those whose ancestry originates from the mainland. Torres Strait Islander peoples’ ancestry originates from the Torres Strait Islands. Indigenous peoples is the term used to include both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, while also associating with Indigenous peoples globally. Each individual, community and group will have different preferences regarding how they are identified. It is good practice to ask their preference and to respect this by using their preferred terms.
First Nations: >
  refer to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. These terms recognise and respect the position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as those who first inhabited and cared for the continent now called Australia. Aboriginal peoples are those whose ancestry originates from the mainland. Torres Strait Islander peoples’ ancestry originates from the Torres Strait Islands. Indigenous peoples is the term used to include both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, while also associating with Indigenous peoples globally. Each individual, community and group will have different preferences regarding how they are identified. It is good practice to ask their preference and to respect this by using their preferred terms.
Caring for Country: >
  is a term used to describe the land management practices and programs that First Nations Peoples undertake, and the role these play in enabling continuing culture. To care for Country is to recognise that the different ecosystems across the continent require different practices to enable sustainable living. First Nations Peoples’ aspirations to care for Country respond to the knowledge and responsibility entrusted to them, providing a deep sense of belonging, purpose and identity.
Respects Country: >
  is a design position. It requires an ethical approach to design and respect for Country and the environment.
Implications for Country: >
  refers to ethical and considered behaviour towards Country and those who are part of Country, including human and non-human.The specifics of this will involve different things on different projects, depending on the capacity within the project and project team to engage with First Nations Peoples and the place itself. Minimum considerations involve the protection of existing cultural materials. The next step is to do no further harm to culture and the environment. At its best, working with ‘implications for Country’ is about celebrating Country through the project. In a rural or outback setting, this could mean enabling cultural practices associated with a site. In an urban context, it might involve engaging with deeper memories and narratives of place.
First Nations land management: >
  refers to a diverse range of cultural, environmental, natural and economic resource management activities that are undertaken by individuals or groups. These include ceremony, knowledge sharing, periodic burning practices (often known as cultural fire or cultural burning), management of water, bush regeneration, bush harvesting or hunting, invasive species control, biodiversity management, art making, and management and maintenance of art sites.
Cultural practices: >
  incorporate any practice of caring for Country that First Nations Peoples carry out that connects them to their culture and Country. A cultural practice is not restricted to ‘traditional’ practices; ‘contemporary’ practices can also connect with culture and Country. Cultural practices are specific to groups and even individuals, and differ depending on the Country and culture from which they originate.
Culturally responsive: >
  refers to being aware of one’s own cultural identity and worldview to enable respectful actions and thoughts towards others’ ideas, beliefs and values, irrespective of whether they differ from one’s own cultural position. Acting in a culturally responsive way requires a level of cultural competence and a recognition that there is no single way of being, acting and knowing. Cultural responsiveness enables equity and inclusion.
Cultural competence: >
  is the values, practices and behavioural skills that enable participation in an ethical and effective way across cultures. Cultural competence ensures cultural safety for all involved.
Cultural safety: >
  is defined as an environment that is safe for all people, in which there are no challenges or denial of others’ identities. In contrast, actions that create culturally unsafe environments include demeaning or disempowering others, and can originate from individual positions or systemic policies, procedures or practices. Cultural safety requires self-awareness of one’s own values, beliefs, perspectives and attitudes that may intentionally or unintentionally harm others.
Engagement processes: >
  are the processes of working in a collaborative way with groups of people affected by or affiliated to a project or place. Engagement seeks to work with stakeholders to achieve equitable decision-making, sustainable outcomes and enduring relationships. Engagement is an ongoing undertaking and assumes that key stakeholders are included in a project from inception to completion and through the ongoing life of the place.
  A meaningful engagement process is one that includes active listening, taking account of stakeholders’ perspectives, and embedding those in outcomes.
Reciprocal relationship: >
  is a relationship that is balanced for both parties, and in which one is not benefiting more than the other. For First Nations Peoples, relationships with land are based on respect and reciprocity. Through kinship structures, First Nations Peoples understand their relationships to each other and everything else in the complex relational system.
Cultural knowledge: >
  is the shared values, norms, worldviews, symbols, and understandings of reality that a group of people believe and think. These differ from culture to culture and are an aspect of the shared knowledge within the culture. First Nations Peoples’ cultural knowledge has accumulated via long and sustained contact with specific areas, ecosystems and resources. This is reflected in narratives, languages, values, beliefs, customs, Laws and social organisation. Unlike cultures that use written word, First Nations Peoples’ cultural knowledge is often oral. As such, First Nations’ cultural knowledge responds to change, absorbing new information and adapting, and therefore is not static.
Knowledge Holders: >
  are individuals and/or particular family groups that hold and maintain specific aspects of cultural knowledge, including knowledge about places, the environment and methodologies of caring for Country. Knowledge Holders and Traditional Custodians are those who can speak for Country due to their deep ancestral connections to place. Each community decides who the Knowledge Holders are within that community. This is not a self-appointed role. While the broader community may be aware generally about features or aspects of cultural knowledge, it is not common practice for detailed cultural knowledge to be conferred in the broader community or First Nations organisations.
Vouching: >
  is using cultural translators or relational guides who are integrated in the community and can introduce you in a culturally appropriate way. Vouching can help both ways – in confirming someone is who they say they are, and that they are of good character.
Authorship of cultural knowledge: >
  refers to appropriately and respectfully crediting those who are the originators, custodians or creators of cultural knowledge, taking responsibility for this occurring, and being accountable towards Knowledge Holders.
Cultural appropriation: >
  is the inappropriate use or application of elements of one culture by members of another culture. This may include identities, practices, customs, ideas, artworks, clothing or designs. It is particularly problematic when a dominant culture exploits a minority inappropriately or for gain at the expense of the original culture.
Aspirations to care for Country: >
  respond to the knowledge and responsibility entrusted to First Nations Peoples, which provides a deep sense of belonging, purpose and identity.
A worldview: >
  is the fundamental overarching comprehension of the world held by an individual or society that informs their values, attitudes, actions and beliefs. It is the perspective from which one interprets the world. The knowledges, worldviews and perspectives of First Nations Peoples differ from those of other peoples as they originate from different societal structures and places.
Culturally responsive methods: >
  employ respectful communication that is thoughtful and inclusive. They rely on having an awareness of one’s own cultural identity and views about difference, and the ability to learn from and relate to those from other cultures.
Health and wellbeing outcomes for Country: >
  involves enabling sustainable and ongoing care of Country activities and supporting and reinforcing First Nations peoples’ relationships to their environments through cultural, physical, spiritual, social and economic inclusion. Health and wellbeing outcomes are interdependent for First Nations Peoples and for Country.
Impact on Country: >
  relates to understanding the impact on the environment. However, it is not the same thing. First Nations Peoples understand themselves to be part of Country and so by impacting Country people are likewise impacted. The intangible aspects of Country such as spirit, cultural expressions, and lore are inseparable from Country; thereby, when impacting Country, the identity, dignity and self-empowerment of First Nations People are also affected. This may be in both positive and negative ways.
Law: >
  when spelled with a capital L refers to the laws, customs and protocols of the land set out in the Dreaming as a set of rules or guidelines for every entity to follow as a means of caring for Country. Laws are not changeable by humans. When spelled with a small l, law is referring to the imported laws that have come from abroad. For reference, lore refers to knowledge or tradition passed from generation to generation through story, song, and other performative expressions. Law and lore are inter-related and rely on each other, whereas law imposes itself on the land, and on First Nations Peoples.

# ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT AND WHOLE LIFE CARBON
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA): >
  is the systematic analysis of environmental impacts associated with the provision of products and services. LCA is a technique for evaluating the environmental impacts of any industrial activity across its entire life cycle – from sourcing raw materials, through manufacture, assembly, use and demolition to the point where all residual materials are returned to the earth. This is known as from ‘cradle to grave’.
  The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) provides guidelines and requirements for conducting a Life Cycle Assessment according to ISO 14040 and ISO 14044.
Whole Life Carbon (WLC): >
  refers to the sum of all greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the construction and use of a building over its entire life, including the demolition, disposal and/or the recycling of the building at the end of its life. WLC includes both operational and embodied carbon impacts. Whole Life Carbon is defined and widely used by World Green Building Council and other authoritative organisations internationally.
  The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) Standard EN 15978 ‘Sustainability of Construction Works – Assessment of Environmental Performance of Buildings – Calculation Method’ defines five lifecycle ‘stages’ and 17 ‘modules’ that are part of WLC. These are:
  – Product stage (modules A1–A3): the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the extraction of raw materials, transportation to a factory and fabrication into useful components
  – Construction process stage (modules A4–A5): the greenhouse gas emissions associated with transporting materials to site and constructing a building
  – Use stage (modules B1–B7): the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of the building over its life, including the materials needed for repair, maintenance and refurbishment and the energy required to operate the building.
  – End of life stage (modules C1–C4): the greenhouse gas emissions caused by demolishing a building, transporting the materials, processing and disposing of waste.
  – Benefits and loads beyond the building life cycle (module D): the greenhouse gas emissions incurred or saved due to reuse, recovery of recycling of materials in the future.
  Measuring WLC includes considering the emissions from a building project across all these different stages. The Standard EN 15978 requirement is to provide a figure for A1–A5, B1–B7 and C1–C4 combined, with D reported separately. However, due to the complexity of measuring these different stages, some reporting does not include all these stages.
Operational carbon: >
  is the greenhouse gas emissions caused by the occupation of a building, facility or place. That is, the emissions due to the lighting, heating, cooling, ventilation, and other energy needs. This is module B6 in EN 15978.
Embodied carbon: >
  is the greenhouse gas emissions associated with raw material extraction, building material manufacture, transport, construction and maintenance and the building’s end of life Embodied carbon can be split into three types:
  – Upfront carbon (sometimes called initial embodied carbon): the emissions caused by the raw material extraction, building material manufacture, transportation and construction of a building (A1-A5)
  – Use stage embodied carbon (sometimes called recurring embodied carbon): the emissions caused by building material repair, replacement and maintenance during the building’s life (B1-B5)
  – End of life carbon: the emissions due to the building’s de-commissioning, demolition, and waste processing (C1-C4)
  When measuring whole life carbon, the unit used is typically given as kgCO2e/ m². This means carbon dioxide equivalence per square metre of floor area. ‘Carbon dioxide equivalence’ refers to the inclusion of other greenhouse gases (Methane, Nitrous oxide, HFCs, etc) which are converted to an equivalent value of carbon dioxide based on their global warming potential (or GWP). In this sense ‘whole life carbon’ effectively means whole life greenhouse gas emissions and is not just limited to carbon dioxide.
Net zero whole life carbon: >
  where a building is where the carbon emissions associated with operational and embodied impacts are net zero or negative over the building’s nominated service life. Given that the vast majority of buildings are responsible for at least some greenhouse gas emissions, this can be incredibly challenging to achieve. As such, a consistent expectation of net zero whole of life carbon is to reduce operational and embodied emissions as much as possible, and then consider offsetting any residual emissions. Offsets may occur through nature-based solutions for carbon removal or other eligible carbon offsets approved under the Climate Active Carbon Neutral Standard for Buildings, or equivalent. However, offsets should always be used as a last resource. In the context of the NSCA, it is vital in the first instance to seek to maximise whole of life carbon reductions. (for instance, see Race to Net Zero Carbon and Whole Life Carbon Vision).
  It is worth noting that net zero carbon can mean different things, and different definitions exist depending on what is being measured. Net zero carbon sometimes only considers operational carbon and ignores embodied emissions (for example, only including module B6). This is called net zero operational carbon, but may still occasionally referred to as ‘net zero carbon’. Clarity on what has been included in any report or documentation is important for transparency.
Design considerations for environmental sustainability: >
  include (but are not limited to) passive solar design, energy efficiency and thermal comfort (operational carbon); the selection of materials, resources and systems of construction to minimise construction waste and maximise reuse and recycling (embodied carbon); the use of non-toxic materials; water consumption and management and the integration of green infrastructure; as well as exploring opportunities for adaptive reuse.
  All these considerations have implications for climate change, and the changing climate will have implications for these in return. These considerations also all have implications for environmental impacts beyond carbon and climate change – for example, resource depletion, habitat and biodiversity loss, environmental pollution and toxicity and so on. Environmental sustainability encompasses all these factors.
Mitigation: >
  is about how good design can mitigate the impacts of climate change and build resilience – for example, aspiring to net zero carbon through good design.
Adaptation: >
  is about how good design can help communities adapt to those impacts that cannot be avoided and builds resilience to climate change.

# TERMS SPECIFIC TO ARCHITECTURAL PRACTICE
Accurate documents: >-
  The requirement to produce accurate, relevant, truthful and unambiguous documentation is enshrined in the various state and territory codes of professional conduct. A failure to comply with this may constitute unsatisfactory professional conduct.
A Client Architect Agreement (CAA): >
  is the formal agreement between the client and the architect. It may also be known as a Client Agreement, Letter of Engagement, Fee Letter or Consultancy Agreement. This generally includes details of the parties to the agreement, the project brief, stages of architectural services being offered, construction budget, the selected project procurement process, program, costs for the phases of service offered, and other secondary or sub-consultants that may be required to assist in undertaking the services, and assumptions and exclusions. The agreement also stipulates the obligations of both parties under the agreement, including compliance with the relevant code of conduct, and other terms and conditions, such as dealings with copyright and moral rights, variations to services, and termination. Specific requirements differ across states and territories. Refer to the relevant Architects Act, regulation and/or code of professional conduct.
  Examples of industry contracts include:
  • Association of Consulting Architects Short Form Client Architect Agreement
  • Consult Australia Short Form and Long Form Consultancy Agreements
  • Australian Institute of Architects Client and Architect Agreement
  Examples of Australian Standard Contracts include:
  • AS 4122-2021
  • AS 4904-2009 for Design and Construct procurement method
Communities: >
  are a group of people bound by commonalities. These shared characteristics and experiences vary widely, and may include aspects such as geographic location, cultural norms, customs, identity, levels of education, interests, nationality, religion, risk profile, social roles and values. Communities exist physically and virtually. They may be small or encompass large group affiliations. The term community may also be used to mean society in general; however, in this instance, community and ‘implication for community’ is focused on the interactions between the built environment and the community it serves.
Complex building: >
  is a project of medium, high or very high “building complexity level” that meets at least two of the criteria defined in the Definitions of the National Construction Code under “Building complexity criteria.”
Complex project: >
  is typically a project of medium scale or larger that requires the application of skills and knowledge to resolve and integrate significant complex components including, but not limited to, siting, planning, structure, services, materials, composition and configuration. A complex project is demanding in its ordering and organisation of multiple occupancy and/or special purpose user requirements and requires the integration of cultural, social, environmental and technical issues.
Construction administration systems: >
  refers to the systems employed to enable architects to carry out their contract administration duties as defined in the Client Architect Agreement, ensuring that the works are executed in accordance with the terms of the construction contract. In addition to the construction services provisions highlighted above, these duties comprise the following: issuing instructions, assessing progress claims, issuing progress certificates, assessing contract price adjustments and extension of time claims, certificate of practical completion and final certificate on completion of the defects liability period. The systems employed include using template forms that are compatible with the construction contract, registers to track claims, variations, and adjustments to the contract sum. Underpinning this should be a robust filing system for storing and retrieving contract information.
Construction services provisions: >
  relate to construction phase services as defined in the Client Architect Agreement. (They are sometimes referred to as construction or site attendance.) These services involve observing conformity to the design intent and quality outcomes embedded in the contract documents. They include attending site meetings; periodic site visits to carry out visual inspections; responding to contractors’ requests for information (RFIs); reviewing shop drawings, mock-ups, prototypes and sample submissions; and carrying out defects inspections and preparing inspection reports. ‘Provisions’ relate to the processes and supporting documentation that must be provided to deliver these services. Processes include programming regular site visits; having an appropriate tracking system for managing responses to RFIs and shop drawing review; and documentation such as monthly site reports, defects inspection reports, and compliance certificates and registers.
Continued engagement: >
  means engaging in a genuine, meaningful and ongoing way from the project conception to completion.
Copyright: >
  is an intangible property right that is founded on a person’s creative work. Copyright law in Australia automatically protects creative work once it is put into material form. Generally, the person who created the work becomes the owner of that copyright. This provides them with exclusive economic rights to undertake certain acts with that material. Copyright protection allows the owner to control how the work will be used. There are some exceptions to copyright ownership, including when employees create works during their employment. In this arrangement, copyright ownership is vested in the employer, rather than in the employee who created it.
Engagement of secondary and sub-consultants: >
  refers to the process, implications, inherent benefits, and risks of either directly engaging consultants or having the client engage the consultants directly. Moreover, there needs to be recognition that whichever form of engagement is adopted, an architect should undertake due diligence on the prospective consultants including confirming their qualifications, their capacity to undertake the project, whether there are limits on their liability, and whether their conditions of engagement are consistent with those of the architect.
Ethical practice management: >
  refers to the provision of a work environment in which everyone is treated equally, with respect and procedural fairness. The framework should make expectations clear and hold everyone to the same standard, promoting acting with integrity and guarding against misconduct. Australian workplace laws cover many of these requirements including pay conditions, health and safety and anti-discrimination.
  The Federal Government Fair Work Act 2009, together with the National Employment Standards, sets out employment practices for most Australian employees that must be complied with. There are other numerous federal and state/territory legislative schemes including requirements for workers compensation, unfair dismissal laws, anti-bullying laws and eliminating slavery in the workplace.
Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP): >
  refers to the rights of First Nations Peoples to protect their heritage and culture. There is no specific legislation in Australia that recognises ICIP; however, it may be protected by legislation related to copyright or trademarks. First Nations communities and individuals are increasingly choosing to implement protocols and contracts that protect their ICIP.
Intellectual property (IP): >
  refers to creations of the mind – for instance, artworks, literary works, inventions, symbols, names, and images. IP is protected by a range of federal legislation, including the Copyright Act 1968, Patents Act 1990, Patents Regulations 1991, the Trade Marks Act 1995, Trade Marks Regulations 1995 and Designs Act 2003.
Moral rights: >
  are the personal rights held by the creator of a work, even if the creator no longer owns the work. Moral rights concern the creator’s right to be correctly credited or attributed, and their work protected from derogatory conduct. Moral rights cannot be assigned or sold. Moral rights are protected under the Copyright Act and have three components – Right of Attribution, Right Against False Attribution and Right of Integrity of Authorship.
Other architectural services: >
  are those beyond the traditional core architectural services. This includes a very wide range of specialist activities – for example, record documentation for heritage restoration, master planning and expert witness services. Before providing these services, the architect should confirm they have the necessary education, experience, and resources to competently undertake them.
Partial services: >
  are when an architect is appointed to only complete some of the core architectural services, such as ‘design only’, ‘design and documentation only’ and ‘partial contract administration only’. It is important to understand the inherent risks associated with providing partial services – for instance, taking over design and documentation services from another architect, or only completing documentation to tender phase. Partial services with limits and exclusions need to be clearly defined.
Periodic site visits: >
  are made by architects in accordance with the Client Architect Agreement. These enable the architects to execute their duty of care and satisfy themselves that the works are being carried out generally in accordance with the contract documents.
Planning controls: >
  include state and territory acts, and planning policies and local council policies.
Post occupancy evaluation (POE): >
  is the process of rigorously and systematically evaluating the performance of a building against specified assessment criteria, objectives, or standards following occupation. A clear statement of the purpose of the post-occupancy evaluation is essential. POEs are usually undertaken between six months and one year after completion although there may be occasions when a longer time period is preferred. A POE may also be carried out on the procurement process itself.
Procurement method: >
  is the process used to bring a building or other project into existence – from client initiation to commissioning and handover. This may also be called the procurement route or strategy. In the NSCA ‘procurement method’ refers to the procurement of a building or other built outcome, rather than the process used to procure the services of an architect or other consultant, or the process of procuring goods.
  A variety of procurement methods and corresponding construction contracts are available. The choice of procurement strategy is influenced by key client objectives and project parameters such as scope, time, quality and cost. These factors also allocate a specific risk profile to the parties involved in each method.
  More commonly used procurement methods include:
  • Lump sum/construct only
  • Design and construct
  • Cost plus
  Some other forms of procurement methods undertaken in Australia include:
  • Novation (often used in design and construct projects)
  • Construction Management
  • Turnkey
  • Public Private Partnership (PPP)
  • Varying relationship models including alliancing and early contractor involvement.
  Typically, all types of construction procurement contracts include the timely and cost-effective management of design delivery, review, and inspection processes as part of the architectural scope of services.
Project costs: >
  refers to the total funds needed to complete a project. It comprises direct costs and indirect costs to the business. Examples of direct costs include labour, materials and equipment. Examples of indirect costs include utilities and quality control processes. Project costs describe the costs associated with the provision of architectural services and relate to the approved architectural fee. They should not be confused with construction costs or costs of works.
Project cost estimates/opinions of probable costs: >
  are preliminary estimates based on professional judgement using historical cost information with adjustment made for specific project requirements.
  It is important to note that these terms are sometimes misinterpreted and misconstrued by both the architectural profession and the wider community. It is, therefore, essential that architects are very clear in communications with clients about what these terms mean and the contexts in which a cost estimate is provided. For example, is the cost estimate a preliminary estimate/opinion of probable cost of the cost or works or the total project cost? Does it include GST? Does it include a contingency sum?
  Any cost estimate should also include caveats around the veracity of the information used to prepare the estimate.
  The client should be in no doubt about the limitations of any advice and be aware that project costs will change over time. Architects should be aware of their obligations and responsibilities under the Client Architect Agreement, and should always confirm with their professional indemnity insurer whether any costing advice provided directly to the client is in an insurable format.
  Additionally. architects must act with integrity and reasonable care in the way they provide information to the client and ensure that the information provided is in a manner that is widely accepted in Australia by peer professional opinion as competent, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Architects also have an obligation to provide timely, accurate and unambiguous information to the client, which means, due to the evolutionary nature of project design development and construction, cost estimations will need to be continually reviewed against the project parameters as they are defined.
Project documentation: >
  includes models, drawings, specifications, schedules, reports, registers and certificates, which are coordinated and cohesive. Documentation evolves over the various phases of a project. The different modes of representation, and levels of detail provided, should be commensurate with the purpose of the document and intended audience. Documentation intended to be issued for construction (IFC) should be fully described and resolved to achieve the project quality and cost objectives, as well as comply with planning controls and construction codes. Some procurement methods will affect the way architectural documentation is prepared; for example, under a design and construct contract, the architect may be required to produce architectural documentation in trade packages.
Project team structures: >
  are groupings of staff with appropriate training and expertise brought together for the express purpose of completing a project according to a defined project brief and scope of services.
Project development options: >
  refers to the process of identifying and analysing contextual considerations, including project brief objectives, budgetary and program objectives and regulatory requirements, as well as consideration for stakeholders, community and the environment. The architect uses this information to assess project viability by creating iterative and culturally responsive exploration studies that appraise a range of ideas. These studies evolve through testing to become informed concept designs. (This may also be known as feasibility studies.)
Project planning: >
  is the act of planning work processes for briefing, designing, documenting, delivering and handing over a project to the client. It is a roadmap that integrates all disciplines. It organises workflows, sets milestones and includes allowances for decision-making, for the purpose of progressing a project to conclusion.
  A project plan, also known as a plan of work, is a framework of planned activities that addresses the specific requirements of the project brief, along with legal requirements, and the procurement methodology. Organised under stages of service, it stipulates the following:
  • tasks and activities to be undertaken
  • project deliverables required
  • program durations for each task and activity (for example, the integration of planning and building approval requirements)
  • accountabilities
  • participant and stakeholder inputs (including local communities and First Nations Peoples)
  • coordination processes
  • important gateway approvals
  • staff resourcing
  The project plan focuses on the ‘what’, ‘how’ and ‘when’ of a project. It maps the steps and identifies when important interactions need to take place with stakeholders, communities and authorities. It guides project outcomes and tracks costs to the business so that adequate staff resources can be allocated to the tasks identified.
Project risk: >
  is the identification of factors that may impact upon the client’s brief, project requirements and objectives. Project risk can also apply to the inherent risks to the architectural practice – for example, the nature of the client, their level of experience and sophistication, and whether they are litigious. Other risk factors include not having appropriate training to undertake services.
Quality and performance standards: >
  can include documents published by government departments and other reputable/authoritative institutions comprising mandatory and preferred quality and performance criteria. They may include aspirational vision and philosophy statements as well as technical standards and checklists/data sheets.
Quality assurance systems: >
  comprise methods and procedures for planning, implementing, executing, and monitoring work processes to ensure the services delivered meet with clients’ and stakeholders’ expectations. Quality assurance systems are used to achieve consistency and reliability in all areas of architectural practice, including meeting contractual obligations, achieving compliance with legal and other requirements, ameliorating risk, and preventing mistakes and defects. They also streamline workflows and assist in maintaining control of flow of information. Quality assurance focuses on preventing defects in the first instance, rather than the quality control aspect of detecting defects after the fact.
  Quality assurance systems can stand alone or form part of a Quality Management System (QMS). A QMS strives to ensure high quality outcomes and high levels of satisfaction for clients and stakeholders. It is based on achieving continual improvement through implementing risk-based thinking and applying the Plan-Do- Check-Act cycle to work processes. A certified QMS describes the nature and culture of the business, identifies quality objectives and targets, contains standards and guidelines, makes commitments including commitment to continual improvement, and is certified by a third-party auditor against the requirements of International Standard ISO 9001.
Regulatory requirements and obligations: >
  refer to the obligations set out in federal and state/territory legislation that affect architectural practice. This includes legislation relating to climate change, sustainability, environmental requirements, heritage, Indigenous and First Nations matters, work, health and safety matters, employment, human rights and antidiscrimination, and the ethical and legal obligations embedded in the Architects Act, state/territory based professional codes of conduct and the Architects Award. This also includes the obligations set out in the National Construction Code (NCC) and applicable Australian Standards.
  Relevant federal regulations include, but are not limited to: ˆ, National Employment Standards, Architects Award 2020, Competition and Consumer Act 2010, Copyright Act 1968 and Copyright Amendment Act 2000, Racial Discrimination Act 1975, Sex Discrimination Act 1984, Disability Discrimination Act 1992, Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2000, National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, Native Title Act 1993, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005, and the Safe Work Australia Act 2008. State/territory legislation varies across Australia, and it is imperative to refer to relevant regulation in each jurisdiction.
Relevant building codes and standards: >
  include the National Construction Code (NCC) and the relevant Australian Standards referenced within the sections of the NCC.
Risk management and mitigation principles: >
  have the objective of identifying risks and addressing them by elimination, modification or management. One of the toolsused to identify risks is a Risk Matrix, which concentrates on the likelihood and consequences of each risk. Risks are then controlled using the ‘hierarchy’ of control measures. Regularly employing risk management strategies is a means of improving the likelihood of project success, particularly for complex projects.
Safety in design: >
  Designers have obligations to design safe places of work under the various state and territory work health and safety legislation. This legislation is based on the model Work Health and Safety Act (WHS Act) and Work Health and Safety Regulations (WHS Regulations) formulated by Safe Work Australia. Safe places of work include the parts of residential development where maintenance works or building servicing is undertaken (for example, waste collection, post and parcel delivery). The legislation and corresponding regulations vary slightly in each state and territory, and it is important that architects are familiar with their duties in the jurisdictions in which they practice.
  A Safety in Design risk analysis includes the following broadly defined steps:
  Step 1 – Hazard Identification
  Step 2 – Risk Evaluation
  Step 3 – Control Measures
  Step 4 – Action Plan
  Step 5 – Maintenance of Risk Management
  A Safety in Design process should consider all stakeholders’ input.
Stakeholders: >
  are those with an interest or concern in something. They generally have responsibilities towards it and an interest in its success. In this instance, project stakeholders refer to clients and those parties with a financial interest in the project as well as the broader user groups – for example, residents, customers, employees, vendors, suppliers, communities and government bodies.
Statutory planning requirements: >
  are those requirements stipulated in statutory planning legislation/policies/instruments that are concerned with the management and regulation of changes to land development and land use.
  Statutory planning instruments comprise federal and state/territory government legislation related to protection of the environment and planning matters of key state/territory and regional interest, as well as local government (council) planning instruments (sometimes referred to as planning schemes) related to local town planning and development. Local governments must take into consideration the state/territory planning instruments when formulating their local planning controls.
